## PiGlow

Here is a small Python module for the PiGlow addon by Pimoroni, it will let you flex the LED muscles of this fantastic addon.

## Files

 - piglow.py - Python module you'll import into your script
 - examples/all.py - This will increase then decrease all the LEDs together
 - examples/arm.py - Cycle each of the PiGlow arms, showing both methods
 - examples/clock.py - Use your PiGlow as a binary clock! Customisable as well!
 - examples/work_clock.py - Use your PiGlow as a 9-5 work clock working it's way through the Spectrum- red is 9am etc.
 - examples/cpu.py - Show your current CPU usage on the PiGlow (requires psutils)
 - examples/cycle.py - This will cycle the colours together from center to the end back to the center
 - examples/cycle2.py - Switch each individual colour using the piglow.colour method
 - examples/indiv.py - Quickly increase and decrease the LEDs independantly
 - examples/indiv2.py - Switch each LED on individually in a loop cycle
 - examples/test.py - You choose the brightness of each LED colour group, to see how it will look
 - examples/halloween.py - Spooky Halloween colours (Red, Orange, Yellow) with random timings and brightness


## Requirements

    sudo apt-get install python-smbus
    sudo apt-get install python-psutil


## Functions

The functions of piglow are:

```python
from piglow import PiGlow
piglow = PiGlow()
piglow.colour([1-6],[0-255])    # 1=White, 2=Blue, 3=Green, 4=Yellow, 5=Orange, 6=Red
piglow.colour([color],[0-255])  # "white", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "red"
piglow.white([0-255])           # Control all the white LEDs
piglow.blue([0-255])            # Control all the blue LEDs
piglow.green([0-255])           # Control all the green LEDs
piglow.yellow([0-255])          # Control all the yellow LEDs
piglow.orange([0-255])          # Control all the orange LEDs
piglow.red([0-255])             # Control all the red LEDs
piglow.all([0-255])             # Control all LEDs together
piglow.led([1-18],[0-255])      # Control an individual LED by number
piglow.led1-led18([0-255])      # Control an individual LED by function
piglow.arm([1-3],[0-255])       # Control an arm of LEDs by number
piglow.arm1([0-255])            # Control the top arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
piglow.arm2([0-255])            # Control the right arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
piglow.arm3([0-255])            # Control the left arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
```

All colours are from 0 (off) to 255 (super duper eye numbing bright!)

## Installation instructions

### Preparation

First to download and install the required libraries

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-smbus python-psutil -y


 - SMBus is required to talk over i2c bus with the PiGlow
 - psutil is required for cpu.py example to get current CPU usage


To enable the i2c driver you need to make a few changes

    sudo nano /etc/modules

Then make sure the following is at the end of the file

    i2c-dev
    i2c-bcm2708

So it looks like this:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/Pictures/etc-modules.jpg" alt="etc-modules"/>
</p>

Ctrl + x and Y to exit save the file, now edit the next

    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

And add the #'s to the beginning of each line so it looks like:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/Pictures/etc-modprobe.jpg" alt="etc-modprobe"/>
</p>

Ctrl + x and Y to exit and save the file, now reboot

    sudo reboot

### Downloading the PiGlow module and testing

Now create a directory for it to live in then change to that directory:

    mkdir piglow
    cd piglow


Next get the latest version of PiGlow python module:

    wget https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/piglow.py

This will give you a file called piglow.py, this is the module and will do all the hardwork.

Now download the test script to make sure it works

    wget https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/Examples/test.py

And run it by typing and setting a number between 0 (off) and 255 (brightest)

    sudo python test.py

If it works successfully you can choose the level of brightness as shown

<img src="https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/Pictures/piglow-test.jpg" alt="piglow-test"/>
</p>

### Starting your script

Now hopefully it should run the test.py successfully, you can browse the other examples created here

    https://github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/blob/master/Examples/

To create your own script just start it with importing the module

    from piglow import PiGlow

Now initialise the module into piglow variable

    piglow = PiGlow()


That's it! 

Use the function list for a list of combinations you can use to set individual or groups of LED's on or off.

A few examples:

    piglow.all(10)    # Set all LED's to 10
    piglow.red(100)   # Set red LED's to 100
    piglow.led(3,0)   # Turn LED (Top yellow off)

And combine it with time.sleep to make effects

    from piglow import PiGlow
    from time import sleep

    piglow = PiGlow()

    piglow.all(0)

    piglow.all(10)
    sleep(1)
    piglow.red(100)
    sleep(1)
    piglow.led(3,0)

## Auto start the clock.py example

Sometimes you a script to start automatically, so you don't have to login each time to start the script. The binary clock script is a perfect one to do this with.

So follow this simple guide to have the binary clock start when you plug your Raspberry Pi in:

After following the Installation instructions and having run the test script:

Make the piglow directory if not already done:

    mkdir /home/pi/piglow

    cd /home/pi/piglow

Download the clock.py script into the /home/pi/piglow folder:

    wget https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/piglow.py
    wget https://raw.github.com/Boeeerb/PiGlow/master/Examples/clock.py

Next create the init.d file, so change to the /etc/init.d folder

    cd /etc/init.d

Now create the file

    sudo nano clock

And paste the following

    #!/bin/sh
    # /etc/init.d/test

    ### BEGIN INIT INFO
    # Provides:          clock
    # Required-Start:    $remote_fs $syslog
    # Required-Stop:     $remote_fs $syslog
    # Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
    # Default-Stop:      0 1 6
    # Short-Description: Simple script to auto start binary clock
    # Description:       Simple script to auto start binary clock
    ### END INIT INFO


     case "$1" in
      start)
        sudo python /home/pi/piglow/clock.py &
        ;;
      stop)
        killall python
        ;;
      *)
        exit 1
        ;;

    esac
    exit 0

Ctrl + x and Y to save, notice there is no file extension

Now make the file executable

    sudo chmod +x clock

And add the clock to the startup scripts

    sudo insserv clock

Try it out without restarting
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/clock start

After you have observed it starting, we should be safe to reboot

    sudo reboot

And thats it!

###

Enjoy!
